#  ðŸ“š"Test" ðŸ“š

***
## This app about magic book. 
You could ask this book about something what worry you.   
When you touch this bookðŸ“•, it gives answer for you! ðŸ˜Ž.   
*Good luck and have fun my Friends!*ðŸ’›
***
I used:
<ul>
<li> Image view</li>
<li> Button </li>
<li> Array </li>
<li> AVFoundation </li>
</ul>

***
When you you start app, you can hear amazing  songðŸŽµ *(I imported for this AVFoundation)*,   
when you opening or closing this virtual book you can hear sound effect ðŸ‘» *(AVFoundation)*:  

>````swift
>    func playSound() {
>        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "shot", withExtension: "mp3")
>        player = try! AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url!)
>        player.play()
>    }
>````

You can open or close this book enough touch the book.   
You can see, when this book's open you can close it touch   
on book or touch it outside of it and it will close. But you   
can't open it when book's close if you touch it outside this book.

___Example a code for click on book:___
````swift
    @IBAction func changeText(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let arrayText = ["YES", "NO", "MAYBE", "NO DOUBT ABOUT IT", "ABSOLUTELY", "THE STARS SAY NO",   
        "SO IT SHALL BE", "UNLIKELY", "INDICATIONS SAY YES", "POSITIVELY", "YOU CAN COUNT ON IT",   
        "ANSWER UNCLEAR ASK LATER", "DON'T BET ON IT", "LOOKS LIKE YES", "CHANCE AREN'T GOOD",   
        "FOCUS AND ASK AGAIN", "CAN'T SAY NOW", "PROSPECT GOOD", "VERY LIKELY", "CONSULT ME LATER",   
        "CANNOT FORETELL NOW"]
        
        if bookImage.image == #imageLiteral(resourceName: "clouse_book") {
            playSound()
            bookImage.image = #imageLiteral(resourceName: "open_book")
            textAnswer.text = arrayText.randomElement()
        } else {
            setBook()
        }
    }
